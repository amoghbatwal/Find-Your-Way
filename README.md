# CSCI-B 551 Elements of Artificial Intelligence

### Find-Your-Way

Working: To begin with, the map is parsed using ‘parse_map’. Then, the beginning position (#) is found. A fringe is maintained which will consist of my starting location, my no. of steps travelled to reach the goal (@) and the direction in which I travel to reach the goal state. The fringe will be changing continuously as we traverse. I have used the method of Breadth First Search for finding my goal since it is definite to get me to my goal. So, I will be removing the first element from the fringe every time to check its valid moves. Valid moves are the moves which are present inside the board as well as are possible to move to. When getting the valid moves, my code also gets the direction in which it is moving as per the valid move. This is important because it’s a way of keeping track of the directions you have moved to reach the goal. After getting all valid moves, the moves are stored so that next time we don’t visit the same position again. This speeds up the executive time. Post that, the move is checked if it has reached the goal or not. If it reaches the goal, the current position along with the direction travelled in terms of N/S/W/E is returned. If not, the move is added to the list of visited moves and the fringe is appended with the move and direction. The distance is also incremented by 1. This process goes on until the fringe is empty or the goal state is reached before fringe getting empty.
